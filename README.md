 JavaScript practice with challenges I pick from various places

This repository will be a collection of my JavaScript practices. I'll pick challenges from variaous sources:
- CodeCademy - https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/10-javascript-code-challenges-for-beginners/ 
- Udemy (Various sources)
- JSChallenger - https://www.jschallenger.com
- edabit.com
- and many others...

I will include notes with my thoughts and may even go back in and revise some of them and clarify any modifications I make to any of these instructions; or even bonus instructions I define myself for an additional challenge.

If I find a challenge I can expand on I will branch this out and work on it to eventually publish if I feel like it's worth it.

Please feel free to fork this, update, critique, etc... as you see where it needs it. I'm learning JavaScript more in-depth than what my current position utilizes when working on SaaS platforms.

NOTE: The index.html is specifically for me to have the browser open and checking the console.
